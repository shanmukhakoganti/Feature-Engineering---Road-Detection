# Feature-Engineering---Road-Detection


In this project, we explored road detection using satellite images, focusing on the segmentation of aerial imagery to accurately identify road networks within diverse and complex rural landscapes. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used for image segmentation tasks due to their ability to learn spatial hierarchies, we decided to adopt a novel hybrid approach that combines traditional edge detection techniques—such as Sobel, Canny, and Laplacian algorithms—rather than relying solely on CNNs.

The motivation behind choosing a hybrid approach over CNNs stems from the specific challenges presented by our dataset. Satellite images often include roads that vary significantly in color, texture, and continuity, blending into natural surroundings like fields and bodies of water. Traditional CNNs, while powerful, can sometimes struggle with these nuances, especially in cases where the features of interest, such as roads, are not distinctly different from their backgrounds or where the dataset is limited.

Our hybrid approach leverages the strengths of multiple edge detection techniques to address these challenges. By combining the Sobel operator's sensitivity to edge orientation, the Canny algorithm's precision in detecting edges while suppressing noise, and the Laplacian's ability to highlight areas of rapid intensity change, we created a more robust method for identifying road networks. This approach allows us to capture the fine details and subtle transitions that define roads in satellite imagery, which might be missed by CNNs due to their tendency to focus on more prominent features.

Furthermore, the hybrid method offers more interpretability compared to CNNs. The process of edge detection and combination is more transparent and can be fine-tuned based on the specific characteristics of the dataset. This flexibility is crucial in a task where the visual characteristics of the target (roads) can vary widely.

In summary, our decision to develop a new hybrid approach rather than relying on CNNs was driven by the need for greater precision and flexibility in detecting complex and subtle features within satellite images. The hybrid method outperforms CNNs in this context by effectively leveraging traditional edge detection techniques to produce more accurate and reliable segmentation results.
